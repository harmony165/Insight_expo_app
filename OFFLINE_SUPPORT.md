# Offline Support in Insight Todo App

## Overview

Your app has been refactored to use **Legend State** for offline-first task management. The app now works seamlessly offline and automatically syncs when back online.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Legend State Integration
- Tasks are now managed through Legend State observables
- Automatic persistence to AsyncStorage for offline access
- Real-time sync with Supabase when online
- Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback

### 2. Offline-First Architecture
- **Add tasks offline**: Tasks are saved locally and synced when connection is restored
- **Toggle completion**: Status changes work immediately, sync happens in background
- **Delete tasks**: Soft deletes with automatic sync
- **Reactive UI**: All components automatically update when data changes

### 3. Files Modified

#### `utils/SupaLegend.ts`
- Complete rewrite to use Legend State properly
- Handles both `tasks` table (future) and `todos` table (current)
- Automatic offline persistence and sync retry logic
- Simplified API with reactive data access

#### `utils/TasksAPI.ts`
- Now a simple re-export layer for backwards compatibility
- All functionality delegated to SupaLegend.ts

#### Components Updated
- `Tasks.tsx`: No longer needs manual loading or subscriptions
- `NewTask.tsx`: Uses Legend State functions directly
- `SwipeableTaskItem.tsx`: Optimistic updates with Legend State
- `ClearTasks.tsx`: Reactive completed task counting

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **User Action** → **Legend State** → **Local Storage** (immediate)
2. **Legend State** → **Supabase** (when online)
3. **Supabase changes** → **Legend State** → **UI updates** (real-time)

### Offline Behavior
- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Clear completed tasks
- ✅ All changes persist locally
- ✅ Automatic sync when back online
- ✅ Conflict resolution handled by Legend State

### Online Benefits
- Real-time updates across devices
- Automatic background sync
- Optimistic UI updates (no loading states needed)
- Infinite retry on failed sync attempts

## Testing Offline Mode

1. **Add tasks while offline**
   - Turn off internet connection
   - Add several tasks
   - Tasks appear immediately in the UI

2. **Modify tasks offline**
   - Toggle completion status
   - Delete tasks
   - Changes are instant and persist

3. **Go back online**
   - Turn internet back on
   - Changes automatically sync to Supabase
   - No user intervention needed

## Technical Details

### Legend State Configuration
- **Persistence**: AsyncStorage with user-specific keys
- **Sync Plugin**: Supabase integration with real-time updates
- **Retry Logic**: Infinite retries with exponential backoff
- **Change Detection**: Based on `updated_at` timestamps
- **Soft Deletes**: Uses `deleted` field for data integrity

### Performance Benefits
- **No Loading States**: Data is always available locally
- **Instant Updates**: UI updates immediately on user actions
- **Efficient Syncing**: Only changed records are synced
- **Memory Efficient**: Observable-based reactive updates

## Next Steps

The basic offline functionality is now working. You can expand this by:

1. **Adding more task fields** (priority, due dates, descriptions)
2. **Implementing the `tasks` table** for richer data model
3. **Adding conflict resolution UI** for complex scenarios
4. **Implementing bulk operations** with batch syncing

Your app now provides a smooth offline experience that rivals native apps!
